# android-dev-sandbox-java

### about this project
This is my playground project to test different things in android.
Some of the stuff in here is from tutorials or blogs, others I just tried out...

#### java
The project is currently all java. Since I switched to kotlin for other projects in the mean time
and kotlin is also the preferred language for android development, I'm gonna switch to a 
android kotlin sandbox project sooner or later - Probably when I have a new android project some day
